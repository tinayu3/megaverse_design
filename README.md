# megaverse_design
Something interesting to design dual universe

## Features
- Phase 1: Uses the megaverse service API to create 🪐POLYanets forming an X-shape
- Phase 2: Has to build another megaverse… including the shape of 🪐logo! This new map has some other entities as well: 🌙SOLoons and ☄comETHs.
           🌙SOLoons can only be adjacent to a 🪐POLYanet, and they can have a variety of colors.
           ☄comETHs can go alone in the universe, but they have a direction they’re facing.
